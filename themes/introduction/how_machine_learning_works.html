<h1>How machine learning work?</h1>
<h3>What is the difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?</h3>
<p>While Machine Learning you have to make the feature extraction (process to turn multidimensional data into unidimensional features), in Deep Learning it is made by the own model.</p>
<p>The biggest problem of Deep Learning is the biggest need for resources and time to run.</p>
<h2>Fundamental elements for Machine Learning</h2>
<ul>
    <li><u>Pattern</u>: The Machine Learning is only able to learn problems with patterns.</li>
    <li><u>There is not only one mathematical model that solve that problem</u>: If the problem is simple and we know exactly which equation solves it, why would I want to use an Machine Learning model to calculate an "aproximate" equation?.</li>
    <li><u>Available data</u>: If you don't have data stored then there is no way you can use Machine Learning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Components of the learning proccess</h2>
<ul>
    <li><u>Input (x)</u>: Features of each entry.</li>
    <li><u>Output (y)</u>: Is the target I want to predict.</li>
    <li><u>Target function (f:x -> y)</u>: Unknown mathematical equation.</li>
    <li><u>Data (x1,y1)</u>: Historical data.</li>
    <li><u>Hipotesis (g:x -> y)</u>: Aproximation of the unknown mathematical equation that my model could create.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the difference between the Hypothesis Space and the Learning Algorithm?</h3>
<p>The Hypothesis Space contains the resources we can use to solve this problem (Like Artificial Neural Network or SVM)</p>
<p>The Learning Algorithm is, looking inside the Hypothesis Space, how I will handle this problem (Like Back Propagation and Quadractic Programation).</p>
