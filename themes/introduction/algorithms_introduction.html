<h1>Machine Learning Algorithms</h1>
<h2>Descritive models</h2>
<p>Business Intelligence is an example of this type of model.</p>
<p>The objective is to look to the past and understand what happened.</p>
<p>Example: How much new customers we got last year?</p>
<h2>Predictive Models</h2>
<p>The difference of this type of model to descritive models is the hability to foresee phenomenons.</p>
<p>In other words, the preditive models use data from the past to predict what will happen in the future, while the descritive model use the data from the pas to understand what happened in the past.</p>
<p>The predictive model is a approximate mathematical function created with data that can foresee phenomenons.</p>
