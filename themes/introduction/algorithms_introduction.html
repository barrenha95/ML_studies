<h1>Machine Learning Algorithms</h1>
<h2>Descritive models</h2>
<p>Business Intelligence is an example of this type of model.</p>
<p>The objective is to look to the past and understand what happened.</p>
<p>Example: How much new customers we got last year?</p>
<h2>Predictive Models</h2>
<p>The difference of this type of model to descritive models is the hability to foresee phenomenons.</p>
<p>In other words, the preditive models use data from the past to predict what will happen in the future, while the descritive model use the data from the past to understand what happened in the past.</p>
<p>The predictive model is a approximate mathematical function created with data that can foresee phenomenons.</p>
<h3>Supervisioned Learning</h3>
<h3>Non-supervisioned Learning</h3>
<h4>Instance based methods</h4>
<p>The idea of the instance based methods is to storage the training examples the generalization is only made when the new instance is materialized.</p>
<p>The idea is calculate the distance between the new instance (for example a request) and the training data. The answer is the same as the nearest point in the training data.</p>
<p>There are some discussions in the academy if it is a model or just an automation, regardless that philosofical issue, the point is that being a model or not, it has the power to solve problems.</p>
<p>Example of models of this type:</p>
<p>KNN - K - Nearest Neighbours</p>
<h5>How the ponderation of distance is made?</h5>
<h6>Continuous data</h6>
<p>We use the euclidian distance (remember of pythagoras theorem, making a triangle.) but the distance Manhattan can be used too when we want to give difference weights to each feature.</p>
<p>To balance the difference between units, we use to normalize the data between [0,1](preprocessing method).</p>
<p>We have other distance metrics to specific situations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Pearson Correlation</i>: Ample use in the bioinformatics and statistics.</li>
    <li><i>Cosine Similarity</i>: Ample use in text classification and high-dimensional data.</li>
    <li><i>Edit Distance</i>: Used to measure the distance between strings, ample use in text classification and bioinformatics.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Discrete data</h6>
<p>If the value is equal, then the distance is 0. If the value is not equal the distance is 1.</p>
<h5>Pros and cons</h5>
<p>A big benefit of this method is that we don't need to know which type of distribution the data has.</p>
<p>A bad thing using this method is that all the processing is made in the time the instance appears, so the processing time can be a bit slowly because to work it needs to compare the new instance with all data of the training dataset.</p>
<h4>Probabilistic methods</h4>
<p>The probabilistic baynesian methods assumes that the probability of two events happens don't depends only on their relation but also in the probability of see those events alone.</p>
<p>Example of models of this type:</p>
<p>Naïve Bayes</p>
<h5>Pros</h5>
<p>They are practical machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>They are famous because of the "golden rule" (smallest error possible) to evaluate other leargnin algorithms.</p>
<h4>Search-based methods</h4>
<p>This type of methods are good to data minning, or in other words: Extraction of informations from data never seen before.</p>
<p>A complex problem is broken into small problems, making easy to find an answer.</p>
<p>Example of models of this type:</p>
<p>Decision Trees</p>
<p>Random Forests</p>
<p>Example of algorithms:</p>
<p>ID3</p>
<p>C4.5</p>
<h5>How the ID3 algorithm work?</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Which atribute is the most important? Let's add it to the root.</li>
    <li>How I know which atribute is the most important? Simple, let's check the entropy.</li>
    <li>What is entropy? It describer the level of disorder in a sample of data. In other words, it show us which atribute is the best to "give order" to the data.</li>
    <li>First the algorithm works with all the examples, selecting the atribute that best order/group the examples, creating an node.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Optimization based methods</h4>
<p>The main objective is to optimize the mathematical function.</p>
<p>Neural Artifical Networks</p>
<p>SVM (Support Vector Machines)</p>
